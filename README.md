# ROKU FLASHBACK: Retro Streaming App

ROKU FLASHBACK is a web-based app built to display a variety of retro movies, TV shows and tunes, organized by decade and filtered according to the user's preferred age group settings ("Parents" vs. "Kids"). Using queries made through the app, users can signup/login, access their profile and settings, and search for their favourite media examples. 

## Requirements
1. Access to your system's localhost directory (or another way to test the site on a local server)
3. A terminal window 
4. A text editor 
5. An up-to-date web browser

## Installation

- Open up index.html in whichever browser you prefer and enjoy!
